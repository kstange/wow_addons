## The Quick Intro

* **Appearance** - Allows changing of border style, size, and shape of the map. Doesn't have to be circular, or even square. Lots of options are available.
* **Compass** - A more flexible north-east-south-west indicator.
* **Coordinates** - Show your location coordinates.
* **Expander** - Make the minimap large temporarily. Great for gathering or finding a tough-to-spot enemy.
* **Location** - Show the name of your location more flexibly.
* **Move Buttons** - Move the buttons around the minimap to wherever you want, or even off the minimap entirely.
* **Ping** - Show which member of your group pinged the minimap.
* **Position** - Position the minimap and frames around it.
* **Quest Tracker** - Adjust the size and appearance of the objectives window.
* **Range Circle** - Show on the minimap where your range extends to.
* **Show Hide** - Show or hide various frames related to the minimap.
* **Tracking Dots** - Change the dots on the map to a different set of images. Very handy, especially if you suffer from colourblindness.
* **Zoom** - Use the mouse-wheel to zoom the minimap, and zooms out automatically after a short delay.

## Configuration

A configuration window can be opened by typing `/chin` or clicking on the minimap (right-click by default, this can be changed or disabled entirely if you prefer).

Almost everything can be turned on or off or tweaked to your liking.
